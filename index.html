                <p class="subtitle">Scores of bracing sea swims due to take place around England over the festive period
                    have been
                    cancelled due to safety
                    fears over the Covid pandemic.</p>
                <p>"Dippers" would usually brave the chilly waters dressed as Father Christmas, elves, or even Christmas
                    puddings to raise
                    money for charity.</p>
                <p>Organisers have asked people to take part in virtual challenges instead.
                </p>
                <p>Despite the official cancellations, a handful of hardy swimmers did still take the plunge in
                    Clevedon, Somerset.
                </p>
                <p>Boxing Day and New Year's Day dips at Clevedon Marine Lake were cancelled but some still braved the
                    lake's icy waters on
                    Saturday.
                </p>
                <p>Outdoor swimming coach Rowan Clarke told BBC Breakfast that demand has soared over recent months.

                <h2>Season of good chill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Ice Warriors, from Hull, took the plunge earlier in December after Covid put paid to the annual
                    New Year's Day event
                    in Hornsea, East Yorkshire.</p>
                <p>Andy Butler, from the group, said: "We normally have a Christmas party, and attend the New Year's
                    Day dip, but obviously
                    we can't this year.</p>

                <p>"So, we thought we would combine the two and have a charity swim."</p>
                <p>Mr Butler said he had never known the event, organised by Hornsea Inshore Rescue, to be cancelled
                    before - "even when
                    the weather was horrible".</p>
                <p>He said it would normally attract a large crowd and raise about £5,000 to help with the costs of
                    running the lifeboat
                    service.</p>
                <p>"We raised about £600," he said. "It's a big drop but better than nothing."
                </p>
                <p>Hornsea Inshore Rescue said fundraising efforts this year had "completely dried up".
                </p>
                <p>Spokeswoman Sue Hickson-Marsay said: "We need £35,000 to £40,000 a year to function and we've had
                    less than £10,000 this
                    year."</p>
